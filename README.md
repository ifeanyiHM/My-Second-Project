# My-Second-Project
In this project i created a clone page https://www.london.ac.uk/applications/funding-your-study#block-studentinformation-menu from the website of The University of London.
I came across this page when i found out from Coursera, the university offers a 100% online computer science bachelor's degree.
I decide to visit the website for more information and got really attracted by the layout of school's site, especially the webpage i recreated.
I resolved to recreate the page using my own code.
There were certain challenges i encountered especially in the area of Javascript but i learnt a great deal working on this project and i am grateful for the whole process.
The tools employed in recreating this webpage are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The decision to employ no frameworks was intented as i wanted to create something purely with the use of html, css and JS alone.

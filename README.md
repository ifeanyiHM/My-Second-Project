# My-Second-Project

In this project i created a clone page https://www.london.ac.uk/applications/funding-your-study#block-studentinformation-menu from the website of The University of London.

I came across this page when i found out from Coursera, the university offers a 100% online computer science bachelor's degree.

I decide to visit the website for more information and got really attracted by to its layout, especially the page i ended up recreating.

I resolved to clone the page using my own code.

There were certain challenges i encountered especially in the area of Javascript but i learnt a great deal working on this project and i am grateful for the whole process.

The tools employed in recreating this webpage are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

It's responsive across three devices (mobile, tablet and desktop device).

The decision to employ no frameworks was intented as i wanted to create something purely with the use of html, css and JS alone.
